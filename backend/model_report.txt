MODEL REPORT

Model Used:
MobileNetV2 (Pretrained CNN Model)

Framework:
TensorFlow / Keras

Dataset:
Custom product dataset containing 20 product images

Accuracy Results:
Total Images Tested: 20
Successful Predictions: 10
Model Accuracy: 50%

Observations:
• Model performs well on general objects
• Accuracy reduces for ecommerce specific products
• Confidence scores vary depending on similarity with ImageNet classes

Limitations:
• Model is not fine-tuned for product dataset
• Some misclassifications observed

Future Improvements:
• Train model on ecommerce product dataset
• Increase testing dataset size
• Add product-specific keyword mapping
